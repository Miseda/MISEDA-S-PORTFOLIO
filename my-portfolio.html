      <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
      <p>During my short time at Moringa school, I have been able to make various projects which are gradually
        developing and becoming better each day</p>
      <h4>This projects are : (TO VISIT SITE CLICK THE TITLE FOR EACH PROJECT)</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-favourite-things">MY FAVOURITE THINGS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is one of the first websites that i ever made and it entail my favourite things ranging from food
        to friends to activities.It is preety simple for it was before i learnt how to use CSS and the styles
        that it entails.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-first-webpage./blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">MY FIRST WEBSITE</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project is actually the first webpage I ever made and it is closely related to my favourite things other than
          the fact that my favourite thing has some <span class="border">photos</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/COOKIE">COOKIE</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now for this project i was learning on HTTML and was given a wrongly written one so that I could correct it and learn
          on the steps and order in which the elements were supposed to be <span class="bold">arranged.</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/Resume">RESUME</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>On to bigger things , this is a project where I made my resume and it turned out beautifully but not as the ones I will
          create in future it features different styles of CSS like <span class="bold">background color, text decoration</span> and it came together pretty well</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/News-report">NEWS REPORT</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is an even better version of my work for I had learnt more styles which I obviously applied to my work.This is a very
          asthetic if not notalgic page which is very beautiful according to me and it entails different types of<span class="bold"> photograph
           , header blocks and font style</span> was what was required.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-favourite-band">MY FAVOURITE BAND</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now this is my favourite project so far because of how it looks like, I think its my finest work so far.Its abou my favourite
          band which is Sauti sol , it contains their picture , information about them and their upcoming shows.I used<span class="bold"> floats and columns
          apart from box modeling and divs.</span></p>


      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>As I said before my is<span class="bold"> Alex Miseda Mumbo</span>. I come from a family of five and have three siblings.I live in Nairobi obviously but I originate
        from Kisumu. At the moment I have just finished my high school education. I went through<span class="bold">Light Academy Secondary For Boys</span> in Karen and in
        primary I went through<span class="bold"> Moi Educational Centre</span>. At the moment I dont have any work experience but in future Ill most probabyly be experienced in
        <span class="bold">Software Engineering</span>.This is part of why I decided to join Moringa school.</p>


      <p>The<span class="bold"> main</span> reason as to why I decided to take on programming is because apart from being an<span class="bold">enjoyable and cool activity</span>it will also help me to be
        <span class="bold">more grounded in software development</span>. In future I plan on taking on Software Engineering in a<span class="bold"> Rwandan University called African Leadership
        University (ALU)</span>and this certificate may contribute to this.</p>
