      <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
      <p>During my short time at Moringa school, I have been able to make various projects which are gradually
        developing and becoming better each day</p>
      <h4>This projects are :</h4>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-favourite-things">MY FAVOURITE THINGS</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is one of the first websites that i ever made and it entail my favourite things ranging from food
        to friends to activities.It is preety simple for it was before i learnt how to use CSS and the styles
        that it entails.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-first-webpage./blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">MY FIRST WEBSITE</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This project is actually the first webpage I ever made and it is closely related to my favourite things other than
          the fact that my favourite thing has some photos</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/COOKIE">COOKIE</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now for this project i was learning on HTTML and was given a wrongly written one so that I could correct it and learn
          on the steps and order in which the elements were supposed to be arranged.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/Resume">RESUME</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>On to bigger things , this is a project where I made my resume and it turned out beautifully but not as the ones I will
          create in future it features different styles of CSS like background color, text decoration and it came together pretty well</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/News-report">NEWS REPORT</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is an even better version of my work for I had learnt more styles which I obviously applied to my work.This is a very
          asthetic if not notalgic page which is very beautiful according to me and it entails different types of photographs as that
          was what was required.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Miseda/my-favourite-band">MY FAVOURITE BAND</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now this is my favourite project so far because of how it looks like, I think its my finest work so far.Its abou my favourite
          band which is Sauti sol , it contains their picture , information about them and their upcoming shows.I used floats and columns
          apart from box modeling and divs.</p>


      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>As I said before my name is Alex Miseda Mumbo. I come from a family of five and have three siblings.I live in Nairobi obviously but I originate
        from Kisumu. At the moment I have just finished my high school education , I went through Light Academy Secondary For Boys in Karen and in
        primary I went through Moi Educational Centre. At the moment I dont have any work experience but in future Ill most probabyly be experienced in
        software Engineering.This is part of why I decided to join Moringa school.</p>


      <p>The main reason as to why I decided to take on programming is because apart from being an enjoyable and cool activity it will also help me to be
        more grounded in software development. In future I plan on taking on Software Engineering in a Rwandan University called African Leadership
        University (ALU) and this certificate may contribute to this.</p>


      <p>On the other hand my hobbies are :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playing soccer</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Playing Fortnite</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
      <ul>
